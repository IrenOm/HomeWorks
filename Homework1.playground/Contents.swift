/*
Exercise 2.2
Declare an Int variable named myAgeInTenYears and assign it the value of your age after 10 years(use the constant myAge and the addition(+) operator).

/*
Exercise 2.3
Declare another daysInYear constant and set it to 365.25 (the number of days in a leap year).

/*
Exercise 2.4
Declare a Float variable named daysPassed and set it to the number of days since you were born plus 10 years (use myAgeInTenYears(variable) and daysInYear(constant)).

Exercise 2.5
Using the print() function, print the phrases like: "My age is <...> years. After 10 years, I will be <...> years old. From the moment of my birth day have passed approximately <...>" . (Symbols (<...>) must be replaced with variable values !)

Exercise 3.
 
Calculate triangle's area and perimeter.
Conditions: triangle length: AC = 8.0, CB = 6.0. The hypotenuse of triangle AB is calculated using the sqrt(Double) function, replacing Double with the sum of squares of length.
 Steps:
 1.Right-angled triangle
 2.Hypotenuse of the triangle
 3.Area of a triangle
 4.Triangle perimeter
